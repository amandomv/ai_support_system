# Design Patterns and Decisions

## Overview
This document explains the key design patterns used in our system and the reasoning behind each choice. We focus on patterns that improve maintainability, testability, and flexibility.

## Core Patterns

### Repository Pattern
We use repositories to create a clean separation between our business logic and data access. This pattern:
- Provides a consistent interface for data operations
- Makes the system more testable through dependency injection
- Allows us to change data storage without affecting business logic
- Simplifies data access code

### Dependency Injection
Dependency injection is central to our architecture because it:
- Makes dependencies explicit and manageable
- Enables easy testing through mocking
- Allows flexible component swapping
- Improves code organization and maintainability

### Factory Pattern
Factories help us manage object creation by:
- Centralizing complex initialization logic
- Providing a consistent way to create objects
- Making the system more configurable
- Ensuring proper object setup

### Strategy Pattern
We use the strategy pattern to:
- Make algorithms interchangeable
- Support different approaches for the same problem
- Make the system more extensible
- Improve code organization

### Observer Pattern
The observer pattern enables:
- Loose coupling between components
- Flexible event handling
- Easy addition of new behaviors
- Better system monitoring

## Pattern Selection

### When to Use Each Pattern
- Use Repository for data access abstraction
- Use Dependency Injection for service management
- Use Factory for complex object creation
- Use Strategy for algorithm variation
- Use Observer for event handling

### Pattern Combinations
We often combine patterns to solve complex problems:
- Repository + Factory for data access
- Strategy + Factory for algorithm creation
- Observer + Strategy for event handling
- Dependency Injection + Factory for service creation

### Anti-patterns to Avoid
We actively avoid:
- God objects that do too much
- Tight coupling between components
- Circular dependencies
- Premature optimization

## Implementation Guidelines

### Interface Design
When designing interfaces:
- Keep them focused and minimal
- Use clear, descriptive names
- Document requirements clearly
- Consider future evolution

### Error Handling
Our error handling approach:
- Uses appropriate exception types
- Provides meaningful error messages
- Handles errors at the right level
- Includes recovery strategies

### Testing Strategy
We test patterns by:
- Writing unit tests for each implementation
- Mocking dependencies appropriately
- Testing edge cases
- Verifying behavior

## Future Considerations

### Pattern Evolution
We continuously:
- Monitor pattern effectiveness
- Consider alternatives
- Adapt to new requirements
- Update documentation

### Performance
We optimize by:
- Profiling pattern usage
- Optimizing critical paths
- Implementing caching
- Monitoring resource usage

### Maintenance
We maintain quality through:
- Regular code reviews
- Updated documentation
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking
