# System Architecture

## Overview
The AI Support System follows a clean architecture approach, emphasizing separation of concerns and maintainability. This document explains the key architectural decisions and their rationale.

## Core Principles

### Clean Architecture
Our system separates business logic from infrastructure concerns, making it framework-independent and easier to maintain. This separation allows us to:
- Evolve the system without being tied to specific technologies
- Test business logic in isolation
- Swap implementations without affecting core functionality
- Maintain clear boundaries between different parts of the system

### Domain-Driven Design
We use DDD to create a clear and accurate representation of our business domain. This approach helps us:
- Create a shared language between technical and business teams
- Identify and maintain clear boundaries between different parts of the system
- Focus on business value rather than technical implementation
- Make the system more maintainable and understandable

### SOLID Principles
Our architecture follows SOLID principles to ensure code quality and maintainability:
- Each component has a single, well-defined responsibility
- The system is designed for extension rather than modification
- Components can be replaced without affecting the system
- Dependencies flow inward, with high-level modules independent of low-level details

## System Structure

### Domain Layer
The heart of our system, containing business rules and logic. This layer:
- Defines the core business entities and their relationships
- Implements business rules and validations
- Is independent of external concerns
- Provides interfaces for other layers to implement

### Application Layer
Coordinates the flow of data and orchestrates business processes. This layer:
- Implements use cases and application services
- Manages transactions and workflows
- Coordinates between different parts of the system
- Handles cross-cutting concerns

### Infrastructure Layer
Provides technical capabilities and external integrations. This layer:
- Implements interfaces defined by the domain layer
- Handles data persistence and external services
- Manages technical concerns like logging and security
- Is easily replaceable without affecting business logic

### Interface Layer
Handles communication with external systems. This layer:
- Exposes APIs and handles requests
- Validates input and formats output
- Manages authentication and authorization
- Provides a clean interface for external systems

## Key Decisions

### Event-Driven Architecture
We chose an event-driven approach because it:
- Reduces coupling between components
- Enables better scalability and resilience
- Supports asynchronous processing
- Makes the system more maintainable

### CQRS Pattern
We separate read and write operations to:
- Optimize for different use cases
- Improve performance and scalability
- Make the system more maintainable
- Enable better caching strategies

### Repository Pattern
We use repositories to:
- Abstract data access details
- Make the system more testable
- Enable technology independence
- Provide a clean interface for data operations

## Data Flow

### Query Processing
When a user submits a query:
1. The system validates and processes the input
2. Relevant documents are retrieved using vector similarity
3. The AI model generates a response
4. The response is formatted and returned to the user

### Recommendation Generation
For personalized recommendations:
1. The system analyzes user history and behavior
2. Patterns and preferences are identified
3. Recommendations are generated based on these insights
4. Results are personalized and returned to the user

## Technology Stack

### FastAPI
We chose FastAPI for its:
- Modern, fast performance
- Built-in async support
- Excellent documentation
- Type safety with Pydantic

### PostgreSQL with pgvector
Our database choice provides:
- Robust, reliable data storage
- Vector support for similarity search
- ACID compliance for data integrity
- Strong community support

### OpenAI Integration
We use OpenAI for:
- State-of-the-art AI capabilities
- Reliable and well-documented API
- Cost-effective solutions
- Continuous model improvements

## Security and Scalability

### Security
Our security approach includes:
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

### Scalability
The system is designed to scale through:
- Stateless design for horizontal scaling
- Efficient caching strategies
- Load balancing and resource management
- Fault tolerance and circuit breakers
