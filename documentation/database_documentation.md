# Database Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the database structure and operations in our AI Support System, focusing on how we store and retrieve data efficiently.

## Database Schema

### Core Tables

#### Users
Stores user information and authentication details:
- Unique identifier
- Email address
- Password hash
- Timestamps for auditing

#### FAQ Documents
Stores our knowledge base content:
- Document metadata
- Content in markdown format
- Category classification
- Vector embeddings for similarity search

#### User Queries
Tracks user interactions:
- Query history
- AI responses
- User context
- Timestamps for analysis

### Relationships
- Users can have multiple queries
- FAQ documents can be referenced by multiple queries
- Queries can reference multiple documents

## Vector Search

### pgvector Extension
We use PostgreSQL's pgvector extension for efficient similarity search:
- Enables fast vector operations
- Supports cosine similarity
- Optimized for high-dimensional data
- Efficient indexing

### Search Operations
Our similarity search:
- Uses cosine similarity for matching
- Returns most relevant documents
- Supports threshold-based filtering
- Includes relevance scores

## Database Operations

### CRUD Operations
We provide standard operations for all entities:
- Create new records
- Read with filtering and pagination
- Update with validation
- Delete with proper cleanup

### Performance Optimization

#### Indexes
We maintain indexes for:
- Primary keys
- Vector similarity search
- Foreign key relationships
- Frequently queried fields

#### Query Optimization
We optimize through:
- Prepared statements
- Connection pooling
- Regular maintenance
- Performance monitoring

## Data Management

### Backup Strategy
Our backup approach includes:
- Daily full backups
- Continuous WAL archiving
- Point-in-time recovery
- Regular testing

### Data Retention
We maintain data for:
- User queries: 90 days
- FAQ documents: Indefinite
- Archived data: 1 year

## Security

### Access Control
We implement:
- Role-based access
- Row-level security
- Encrypted connections
- Audit logging

### Data Protection
We protect data through:
- Password hashing
- Data encryption
- Security audits
- Compliance monitoring

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics
We track:
- Query performance
- Index usage
- Connection status
- Resource usage

### Alerts
We monitor for:
- High latency
- Connection issues
- Space warnings
- Failed queries

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
We perform:
- Index maintenance
- Statistics updates
- Vacuum operations
- Performance tuning

### Troubleshooting
We handle issues through:
- Query analysis
- Index optimization
- Connection management
- Performance profiling
